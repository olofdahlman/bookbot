# bookbot
First program - book analysis bot.
This is a training project I'm undertaking as a part of the boot.dev course. Now completed and read to use. The code only accepts files of books where each word can be read by the program, scanned pdf files or other forms of media may not work - use at your own discretion.

In addition to the lowercase letters of the alphabet, I added counters for other characters and numbers for training's sake. There is also a presently unused function to count formatting characters like linebreaks, also added for trainings sake. This feature would have to be enabled by looking at the comments in the code.
